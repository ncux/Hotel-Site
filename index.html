                I was once in a group and this chick enters and starts talking LOUDLY on discord and dudes all drool over her. She then proceeds to say "oh haha yeah I am probably the only REAL female who games"
                and everyone agreed with her. And I'm sitting there, staring at my boobs thinking "shit, that means I'm a dude. Who woulda thunk it". And I'm sure people are gonna say I'm jealous.
                Hell no, I like my individuality. I very rarely use voice chat. I went a year in my WOW guild with people thinking I'm a guy because all my usernames or character names are gender neutral
                AND I DON'T ACT LIKE A HORNY SCHOOL GIRL WHO JUST GOT HER FIRST DILDO.

            <p>I have a cable Type C to HDMI which works great for my TV from my phone, but I want to also charge it, is there a cable that is Type C
                to Two Type C holes?

            <p>That's awful. It's bad enough they deal with long hours on the road, now they have to deal with fucking insurance scammers like this?

            <p>It took a toll on me, I performed bad at my work and I was distant from my family, I was crushed and I hoped she would come back and that we would cry together,
                agree it was a mistake and move on.
